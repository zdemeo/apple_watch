## Running Pace Exploration
In this project, I investigate how different factors affect my running pace. Intuitively, runners know that things like elevation gain and temperature affect performance, but how much, exactly, does this affect pace? From these features, is it possible to predict running pace with some certainty?

Runs were logged with Strava, sleep with AutoSleep, and heart rate data were collected using a Polar H10 chest strap.
